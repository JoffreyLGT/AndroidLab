# Lab
Welcome to my lab.
You'll find here some of my toy apps that i have made before implementing stuff into my app.
Feel free to use them for your own app and feel free to ask me if there is something that you don't understand.

## BNV_and_ViewPager
Contains a Bottom Navigation View and a View Pager to display multiple fragment.
It's the base of the UI used in MySteamGames.

## MaterialProfile
Profile Activity using an AppBarLayout. You can find an implementation of it in MySteamGames.
